# Bioinformatics

Welcome to my Bioinformatics repository. This collection contains various bioinformatics analyses and scripts that I have developed for classes and projects. Each folder/project focuses on different aspects of computational biology, from sequence analysis to comparative genomics, using languages like Python, R, and Bash.
